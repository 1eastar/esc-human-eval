I am here to chat :) What is on your mind? \nseeker: My partner ran off with another woman and I simply cannot get over it. Why did he do this to me? \nsupporter: I'm so sorry to hear that, that is really rough. He sounds like a real jerk if you ask me! \nseeker: I know he could be at times and he did have a roving eye but I loved him and I miss him a huge amount, despite everything. \nsupporter: I get that, it's hard to understand why the people close to us do bad things. \nseeker: I think the biggest problem is that I keep wondering what his new girlfriend is like and if she is prettier or cleverer than me. I do not know what I did wrong.\n\n",

I'm mostly bummed because of my work. \nsupporter: It has been a really weird year hasn't it? Don't worry, I think it's been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? \nseeker: Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss (the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. \nsupporter: That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be! Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? \nseeker: I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don't think so... He's the VP there isn't anyone I can go to above him. \nsupporter: That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint? It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. \nseeker: I don't know if it is or not...

        "context": "Dialogue context: \nsupporter: Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview? \nseeker: Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days. \nsupporter: That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort. \nseeker: Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however? \nsupporter: Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help? \nseeker: There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually!\n\n",

And you seem intelligent and analytical also and you know what I mean. So I do appreciate your time and input. \nsupporter: Nice! Good job with those things. \nseeker: thanks. I hope you best of luck then with all your endeavours. I know we can all get through this time. Thank you. stay well and stay safe my friend.\n\n",

I'm just getting household chores done, nothing too exciting. \nseeker: I'm feeling alright. The current pandemic situation in my city has made it restricted to be with people other than immediate family so that's been tough. I'm currently studying finance and I'm loving it. I'm in my last year so I can't wait to finish that up. \nsupporter: I understand that it is really difficult to be kept on lockdown. Are you biking regularly to help with the feeling of being stuck inside? \nseeker: Yes. It's great that my city has a program where we can get a bike pass for $99/year. There are bike stations set up all over my city so that has helped with my sense of being cooped up. It's really helpful in these times to find something to keep yourself productive and mindful that things are going to get better. \nsupporter: I agree, It's really great that you are finding ways to get out of the house. Have you tried video chatting with the people you can't be around right now? That has really helped me not feel so alone right now. \nseeker: I have and that has helped for me as well.
