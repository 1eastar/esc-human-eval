It sounds like your fiance brought so much joy and love into your life. Even though he may not be physically here with you anymore, the love that you both shared will always remain in your heart. Take comfort in knowing that his love for you was genuine and unconditional. And remember, it's okay to have days where the grief feels overwhelming. Allow yourself to feel those emotions and be kind to yourself as you navigate through this difficult time.",

    "context": "supporter: I think that is definitely one way to look at it. But another way to look at your situation is you figured out a therapist who isn't worth seeing. That brings you one step closer to finding one who does actually help you. All you need to do now, is do some research and find someone who has your best interest in mind. Believe me, there are great therapists and terrible therapists. You just need to find one of the good ones now.\nseeker: I'm not sure I can find another who I don't have to pay. My insurance has a $20 copay and if I had to pay that I wouldn't be able to buy groceries. This came through my religious organization and he was the only one available in my area. I guess I just have to find another way to cope.\nsupporter: If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved. When I was younger and struggling, this had happened to me and I received both of these benefits and it totally turned my life around. I think it can do the same for you as well.\nseeker: I'm on Medicare and supplemental insurance. I didn't know you can, possibly, see one for free. I'll look into that. That is helpful.\nsupporter: Sure thing. What are some of the coping strategies you've been practicing with your prior therapist?\nseeker: I asked him to help me with some but all he would say is that I should stop vaping (I switched from smoking some years ago). I told him it feels like I'm walking a tightrope and he's suggesting I get rid of the safety net without giving me something else, some other way to cope.
