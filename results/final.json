This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me. In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done.\nseeker: Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying?

Instead of offering more suggestions, it might be more beneficial to ask the seeker open-ended questions to help them articulate their feelings and thoughts about their writing. This could help the seeker gain more clarity and understanding about their own feelings and motivations, and might lead to a more productive conversation about their writing process. Asking questions could also help the seeker feel more supported and understood in their struggles.\n[UTT FEEDBACK] The response you provided does not address the seeker's feelings of self-doubt and lack of motivation. It would be more helpful to acknowledge the seeker's feelings and offer specific advice or suggestions to address these issues. For example, you could ask the seeker about their daily routine and offer specific advice on how to incorporate writing into their routine, or suggest resources to help them overcome their lack of motivation."

The seeker is expressing a specific plan to move away, and providing information or suggestions about how to achieve this goal would be more beneficial. This could include offering advice on saving money for the move, finding resources for support while living far away, or exploring options for alternative living arrangements if moving away is not feasible. Providing practical guidance can help the seeker feel more empowered and supported in their plan to improve their situation.\n[UTT FEEDBACK] The response could have been more helpful by providing useful information or suggestions related to the seeker's expressed desire to move away once they are 18. Instead of just offering reassurance, the supporter could have provided some guidance on how to save money for that move or how to find a place to live."
